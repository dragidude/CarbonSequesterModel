# Johnny Algae Sea - Carbon Sequestration Calculator

A simple, standalone HTML calculator for modeling algae-based ocean carbon sequestration. This project provides "napkin math" calculations to test the viability of deploying algae to regions of the ocean where they can sequester carbon dioxide by growing, dying, and sinking to great depths.

## üìä Model Parameters

### üå± Biological Parameters
- **NPP (Net Primary Productivity)**: 50-500 g C/m¬≤/yr
- **Export Fraction**: 10-80% of algae that sink to depth
- **Carbon Content**: 30-60% of biomass dry weight
- **Doubling Time**: 6-72 hours for algae population growth

### üåä Environmental Parameters
- **Area**: 100-10,000 km¬≤ deployment area
- **Euphotic Depth**: 20-200 m where photosynthesis occurs
- **Temperature**: 10-40¬∞C optimal range 20-30¬∞C
- **Salinity**: 20-45 ppt optimal range 30-40 ppt

### üí∞ Economic Parameters
- **Cultivation Cost**: $0.1-2.0 per kg biomass
- **Delivery Cost**: $0.1-1.0 per kg to deployment site
- **Vessel Cost**: $1,000-20,000 per day operational costs
- **Monitoring Cost**: $50,000-500,000 per year

### üéØ Targets & Weights
- **Target Cost**: Competitive threshold (typically $50-200/t CO‚ÇÇ)
- **Target Scale**: Desired annual CO‚ÇÇ removal (Mt/yr)
- **Permanence**: Required storage time (typically >100 years)
- **Cost/Scale/Environmental Weights**: Customize assessment priorities

## üìà Sample Results

### Example: Productive Tropical Deployment
**Parameters:**
- Area: 1,000 km¬≤
- NPP: 200 g C/m¬≤/yr
- Export Fraction: 40%
- Temperature: 25¬∞C (optimal)

**Results:**
- **CO‚ÇÇ Removed**: ~147,000 tonnes/year
- **Cost per Tonne**: ~$450/t CO‚ÇÇ
- **Viability Score**: 0.12/1.00 (Low - too expensive)

### Getting to Viability
To achieve competitive costs (<$100/t CO‚ÇÇ):
- Increase scale (larger areas)
- Improve algae efficiency (higher NPP/export fraction)
- Reduce operational costs (vessel, cultivation)
- Deploy in optimal conditions (temperature, nutrients)

## üéØ Key Insights

1. **Scale is Critical**: Larger deployments (>1000 km¬≤) improve economics
2. **Export Fraction Matters**: More algae sinking = more carbon sequestered
3. **Environmental Optimization**: Stay within optimal temperature/salinity ranges
4. **Cost Drivers**: Vessel operations and cultivation are major expenses
5. **Viability Threshold**: <$100/t CO‚ÇÇ needed for competitiveness with other CDR methods

## üîç Understanding the Calculator

### Viability Scoring
The calculator uses a weighted scoring system:
- **Cost Score**: Based on cost per tonne vs. target (lower is better)
- **Scale Score**: Based on CO‚ÇÇ removal vs. target scale (higher is better)  
- **Environmental Score**: Based on permanence and leakage risk

### Cost Categories
- **‚â§50% of target**: Excellent (Score: 1.0)
- **‚â§100% of target**: Good (Score: 0.8)
- **‚â§150% of target**: Fair (Score: 0.4)
- **‚â§300% of target**: Poor (Score: 0.1)
- **>300% of target**: Unviable (Score: 0.0)

### Debug Features
Open browser console (F12) to see detailed calculation breakdowns including:
- Individual component scores
- Weighted contributions
- Parameter validation
- Step-by-step calculations

## üîß Troubleshooting

**No results showing?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Ensure all parameters are positive numbers
- Try refreshing the page

**Cost weight seems to have no impact?**
- Check if cost score is 0 (project too expensive)
- Adjust parameters to get cost into viable range first
- Use debug console to see weighted component contributions

**Viability score seems wrong?**
- Verify weight percentages add up reasonably
- Check that environmental weight isn't being double-counted
- Use debug output to trace calculation steps

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Seasonal variation modeling
- Multiple algae strain comparisons
- Economic scenario analysis
- Sensitivity analysis tools
- Batch parameter testing
- Results export functionality

## üìÑ Model Limitations

- Simplified environmental response models
- Assumes constant conditions (no seasonal variation)
- Doesn't model ecological interactions
- Basic economic assumptions
- No regulatory/permitting costs
- Assumes technology feasibility
