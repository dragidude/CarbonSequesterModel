# Algae Carbon Sequestration Model - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive modeling framework for evaluating the viability of genetically modified algae/cyanobacteria for ocean carbon sequestration. The model addresses the "napkin math" requirements to test the viability of spraying GM algae to regions of the ocean where they can sequester carbon dioxide by growing, dying, and sinking to great depths.

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. Scale is Critical
- Operations need to be large (>1000 km²) for economic viability
- Smaller operations have high per-tonne costs
- Economies of scale are significant

### 2. Strain Selection Matters
- Fast-growing strains (12-24 hour doubling) perform best
- High export fractions (>40%) are essential
- Environmental tolerance is crucial

### 3. Environmental Fit is Paramount
- Temperature and salinity mismatches can reduce sequestration to zero
- Nutrient availability significantly affects growth
- Light penetration depth is a key limiting factor

### 4. Cost Structure
- Vessel operations are major cost drivers
- Monitoring and regulatory costs are significant
- Biomass cultivation costs vary widely

## 🚀 Recommendations

### 1. Focus on Fast-Growing Strains

## 🎯 Conclusion

The algae carbon sequestration model shows **promising potential** for large-scale carbon dioxide removal, with costs potentially below $10/t CO₂ for optimized scenarios. However, the model also highlights the **critical importance** of:

1. **Strain selection** (fast-growing, high-export strains)
2. **Environmental fit** (optimal temperature, salinity, nutrients)
3. **Scale requirements** (large operations for economic viability)
4. **Safety considerations** (genetic kill switches, monitoring)

The model provides a valuable framework for "napkin math" evaluation of this carbon sequestration approach, but **real-world validation** is essential before any large-scale deployment.
